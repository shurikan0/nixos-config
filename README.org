TLDR:
- =phoenix sync= - Synchronize system and home-manager state with config files (essentially =nixos-rebuild switch= + =home-manager switch=)
  - =phoenix sync system= - Only synchronize system state (essentially =nixos-rebuild switch=)
  - =phoenix sync user= - Only synchronize home-manager state (essentially =home-manager switch=)
- =phoenix update= - Update all flake inputs without synchronizing system and home-manager states
- =phoenix upgrade= - Update flake.lock and synchronize system and home-manager states (=phoenix update= + =phoenix sync=)
- =phoenix refresh= - Call synchronization posthooks (mainly to refresh stylix and some dependent daemons)
- =phoenix pull= - Pull changes from upstream git and attempt to merge local changes (I use this to update systems other than my main system)
- =phoenix harden= - Ensure that all "system-level" files cannot be edited by an unprivileged user
- =phoenix soften= - Relax permissions so all dotfiles can be edited by a normal user (use temporarily for git or other operations)
- =phoenix gc= - Garbage collect the system and user nix stores
  - =phoenix gc full= - Delete everything not currently in use
  - =phoenix gc 15d= - Delete everything older than 15 days
  - =phoenix gc 30d= - Delete everything older than 30 days
  - =phoenix gc Xd= - Delete everything older than X days
